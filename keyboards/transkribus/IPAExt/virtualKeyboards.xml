        Configure virtual keyboards here.
        The key of every entry is the name of the tab that is added to the GUI. 
        The value of the entry is a list of unicode characters OR a valid unicode range in 4-digit hex-format 
        (i.e. 0080-00FF for Latin-1 supplement) - Note that both, a list of characters and multiple ranges, can be combined 
        into one keyboard by separating the values with a whitespace!
        The keyboards are sorted by their name in the GUI - add leading numbers to enforce a special order!
        The keyboard was created automatically. The basis was the snapshot of MUFI: The Medieval Unicode Font Initiative (https://mufi.info/m.php?p=mufiexport)
