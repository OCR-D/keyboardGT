                Configure virtual keyboards here.
                The key of every entry is the name of the tab that is added to the GUI. 
                The value of the entry is a list of unicode characters OR a valid unicode range in 4-digit hex-format 
                (i.e. 0080-00FF for Latin-1 supplement) - Note that both, a list of characters and multiple ranges, can be combined 
                into one keyboard by seperating the values with a whitespace!
                The keyboards are sorted by their name in the GUI - add leading numbers to enforce a special order!
                The keyboard was created automatically. The basis was the snapshot of MUFI: The Medieval Unicode Font Initiative (https://mufi.info/m.php?p=mufiexport)
